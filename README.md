# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
   I was building a program that managed and displayed course information such as course number, title, and preequistes attached to that number. The course info was read form 
   a file, then stored in a data structure. The primary data structure for storing the course information was a hash-table. I also needed to create a menu that would display 
   options for interacting with the stored courses.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
   I began by creating psuedocode according to the rubric provided. Moving from one function to another, which allowed me to develop the program incrementally. When it came 
   down to choosing a data structure, we were required to choose one through analysis to find which would work best for our code. Things such as speed performing certain 
   operations like editing - retreiveal, removal, or addition of elements were taken into account, which led to me ultimately choosing a hash table. 
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
   I simply went over my code using the error messages to look at areas I might have messed up in. If there was an error I couldn't fixed, I just searched up common fixes for 
   that particular error on google. This proved to be effective and helped me fix several errors. In some cases, I took a little break to clear my mind and come back.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
   Well, in regards to the complexity of the program and numerous data structures I worked with, there was experience gained, but this only came on the back of skill I used 
   previously, such as psuedocode and incremental programming. 
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   With the help and use of psuedocode, my code is definitely more structured, maintainable, cleaner, and allows me to follow along properly
